## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_FOR_NEXT` in production environment
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_FOR_PYTHON` in production environment
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly configured

### Backend Integration
- [ ] Ensure Python backend is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Verify CORS configuration on backend
- [ ] Test API endpoints with production URLs

### Domain & SSL
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Verify HTTPS redirects

### Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring

### Testing
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm run test:build`
- [ ] Test on multiple devices and browsers
- [ ] Verify responsive design
- [ ] Test error scenarios

### Performance
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit
- [ ] Optimize Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Verify bundle size optimization

## 🚨 Critical Production Requirements

### Environment Variables (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Production URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_DOMAIN_FOR_NEXT=https://your-domain.com
