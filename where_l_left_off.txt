Having several issues: for one, when it redirects to the location page it has a white background for a moment. Another issue is that once you decline the modal it wont save the cookie and redirect the page. It will if you refresh the page but you shouldn't have to.

TODOS:
-need to build the components that will hold the uv index info
-need to write a server action that sends a get request to the flask api
-need to add mobile views
-need to color the modal according to the color palette
-need to work on the backend python script
-later will need to add code for if in production what the domain will be for getAddressData
